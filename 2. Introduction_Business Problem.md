## Predicting the Improvement of NBA players

__1.1 Background__
National Basketball Association (NBA) is the best basketball league in the world with millions of fans worldwide. How players on a team perform is the most important factor that determines which team wins the championship. Playersâ€™ pay are largely based on their past performances. However, player performance change from season to season. Each year there are a number of players who improve dramatically over last year. Those players bring a lot of value, both competitively and economically, to the teams they belong to. Their importance is widely recognized by the NBA in that the player who improved the most over last season is awarded Most Improved Player (MIP) Award. Therefore, it is advantageous for teams to accurately predict whether and how much a player will improve in the next season. For example, this information can be used to target players to acquire in trades or signings.

__1.2 Problem__
Data that might contribute to determining player improvement might include his performance last season, his age, his draft status, his position, and metrics that describe what kind of player he is. This project aims to predict whether and how much a player will improve the next season based on these data.

__1.3 Interest__
Obviously, NBA teams would be very interested in accurate prediction of player improvement, for competitive advantage and business values. Others who are interested in NBA such as fans and fantasy basketball players may also be interested.
