__Data sources__

Most player stats, position, age, and draft position data can be found in this two Kaggle datasets https://www.kaggle.com/alvarob96/laliga_2018-19_season_player_stats and https://www.kaggle.com/pabloreyesalmagro/laliga-players-stats-2019

__Data cleaning__

Data downloaded is combined into one table.
I decided to only use data from 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 seasons.
